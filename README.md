# Text-Prediction-Mechanism-using-Trie
Modern search engines and messaging applications offer auto-complete or text prediction features, where the system suggests possible queries or words as the user types. The goal of this project is to design and implement an efficient text prediction mechanism that returns the most relevant completions for a given input prefix.
